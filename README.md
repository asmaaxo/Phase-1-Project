## Description
This Recipe App is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view a list of recipes, filter them based on a search term, like (upvote) their favorite recipes, and toggle between dark and light modes. The app fetches recipe data from a local json-server that serves data stored in db.json.
